- 👋 Hi, I’m @Sumiko-Nakano
- 👀 I’m interested in mixed martial arts (MMA), creative writing, and exploring the intersections between physical discipline and storytelling.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning advanced techniques in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu and experimenting with narrative structures in my latest writing project.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that seek to empower through martial arts or that offer innovative platforms for sharing stories of resilience and strength.
- 📫 How to reach me: You can contact me through direct messages here on GitHub or via my professional email listed on my profile.

- ⚡ Fun fact: Despite my quiet nature, I find profound expression and voice in the discipline of MMA and the craft of storytelling. "Through Silence my Spirit roars and in the cage I find my voice."
